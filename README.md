# VAE-jets

This repository contains all the code to. The paper demonstrates the use of variational autoencoders (VAE) as powerful tools for jet simulation. With the growing popularity and success of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in high energy physics, we explore variational autoencoders for calorimeter response simulation and compare it to the Location-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (LAGAN).
