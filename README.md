# VAE-jets

This repository contains all the code to. The paper demonstrates the use of variational autoencoders (VAE) as powerful tools for jet simulation. With the growing popularity and success of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in high energy physics, we explore other types of generative models for calorimeter response simulation.
